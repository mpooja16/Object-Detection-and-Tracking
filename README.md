Object Detection is a computer vision technique that involves identifying and localizing objects of interest within an image or video frame. It outputs bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores for each detected object.

Key Models Used:

YOLO (You Only Look Once): Real-time, single-pass detection model.

Faster R-CNN: Two-stage detector with high accuracy.

SSD (Single Shot Detector): Efficient single-stage alternative.

Each model uses deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract spatial features and classify objects.

Object Tracking extends detection by assigning a consistent ID to each detected object across multiple video frames, enabling the system to track their trajectory over time.

Tracking Techniques:

SORT (Simple Online Realtime Tracking): Uses Kalman filters + Hungarian Algorithm.

Deep SORT: Adds a re-identification model for more robust tracking based on appearance features.

üì∂ Workflow Pipeline

Frame Capture: Video frames extracted via OpenCV or video stream.

Object Detection: Each frame is passed through a detector (e.g., YOLOv5) to identify objects.

Feature Extraction (for Deep SORT): Appearance embeddings are generated for each detection.

Tracking: Detections are linked over frames using motion + appearance cues.

Display: Bounding boxes with class names and unique IDs are overlaid on frames in real-time.
